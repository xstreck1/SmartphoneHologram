# SmartphoneHologram
September 2015 Berlin Mini Game Jam -- pseudoholographic tamagochi.

This project requires a specific hardware, which I build based on this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YWTtCsvgvg .

This is a good starting project if you want to build a pseudo-holographic unity project. 
All the cameras, projections and controls are set and ready.
